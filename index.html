    <h1>Residents of El Zonte and the Bitcoin Beach Initiative</h1>

    <h4>
        There is still stigma surrounding cryptocurrency in 2021. Banks pay millions of dollars to fund misinformation
        campaigns
        against the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). When people talk about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, they
        typically laugh and say ‘Can I use it to pay my bills?’ While decentralized finance companies realize cryptocurrency
        isn’t widely accepted yet, they know it is just a matter of time before it is. That is precisely what the villagers
        of
        El Zonte did. They actually are paying their bills using Bitcoin, a type of cryptocurrency.

        <h2>Using Bitcoin in Real Situations- A Small Case Study</h2>
    
        <p>
            Along the beautiful coastline of El Salvador lies the charming village of El Zonte; approximately 3,000 people reside
            there. Unfortunately, the picturesque El Zonte was financially devastated by the COVID-19 shutdown (much like the rest
            of the world). However, residents of El Zonte were given a rare opportunity. An anonymous person donated a thumb drive
            full of Bitcoin to fellow businessman, Michael Peterson, a resident of San Diego and founder of the Bitcoin Beach
            Initiative. The anonymous philanthropist gave Peterson the thumb drive to disperse to the residents of El Zonte—under
            one condition. Michael Peterson had to promise not to cash out the thumb drive. Instead, the residents of El Zonte had
            to learn how to operate Bitcoin.

        </p>
    
        <p>
        After initial resistance, it wasn’t long before people used Bitcoin to pay bills, buy groceries, and purchase supplies.
        This small initiative created a mini-economy entirely founded on Bitcoin. Peterson explains, “Originally, it didn’t make
        sense for 25 cent transactions, but did for 5 dollars. But when the transaction costs ramped up again, we switched over
        to the Lightning Network.” The Lightning Network is a secondary payment protocol that allows instant, affordable
        transactions, so people can buy smaller-priced items.

    supplies.”</h4> 

        <h2>So How Are the Villagers of El Zonte Doing Today?</h2>

        <p>Bitcoin Beach is impacting El Zonte long term. Today, the Bitcoin Beach Initiative is funding education, youth work
        programs, school transportation, and universal cash transfers to families in need. The local water department is finally accepting Bitcoin as well. There is a new system currently being designed to pay
        contractors, builders, and suppliers to construct needed infrastructures for the El Zonte village.
        
        </p>

        <p>Bitcoin has multiple training stations on El Zonte to teach the older generation how to use cryptocurrency. Michael
        Peterson comments, “As we injected Bitcoin into the community, we also taught local businesses how to accept it and
        helped educate them on the advantages and drawbacks of accepting Bitcoin...There was a lot of resistance among the
        adults, [it was] too technical. So we moved on to youth, they picked it up right away. The key is to get them to start
        transacting right away, then they want to learn more about it, the security of it, and how it works.”
</p>

        <p>The project in El Zonte is an ongoing process. One can’t help but wonder what opportunities will be available to
        residents of El Zonte next year given the economic growth they experienced in a short period.
